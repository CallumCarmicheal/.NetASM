# The goal
Create a simple scripting language in Assembly, this wont be actual assembly code but close as if a copy!

If it all goes good i may even make a really bad compiler to go with this ;)


# What CPU is the ASM Based of
Mainly X86 but it may contain others.

# Will this be practical?
Not in the slightest just for fun

# Will this be async process
Yes it will be but not at the moment
